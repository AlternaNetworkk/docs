# How to stake delegator

Note: This tutorial assumes you already have a MetaMask wallet set up and connected to the Alterna Network mainnet.

Step 1: Visit the Staking Delegator Website Open your web browser and go to the Alterna Network Staking Delegator website at [https://staking.alternanetwork.org/](https://staking.alternanetwork.org/).

Step 2: Connect Your Wallet Click on the "Connect Wallet" button on the website. A MetaMask popup will appear, asking you to connect your wallet. Select your MetaMask wallet from the list and click "Connect".

Step 3: Ensure You're Connected to Alterna Mainnet Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is connected to the Alterna Network mainnet. You can confirm this by checking the network indicator in the MetaMask extension, which should display "Alterna Network" or the appropriate network name.

Step 4: Choose Validators On the Staking Delegator website, browse through the list of available validators. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and securing the network. Take your time to research and consider factors such as the validator's reputation, performance, and rewards distribution policy.

Step 5: Input Staking Amount Once you have chosen the validator(s) you want to delegate to, input the amount of Alterna native coins you wish to stake. Please ensure that you have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover the staking amount.

Step 6: Stake and Sign Transaction Click on the "Stake" button. A MetaMask transaction popup will appear, displaying the details of the staking transaction. Review the details, set the gas fee (if necessary), and click "Confirm" to initiate the staking process. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Alterna Network.

Step 7: Done Congratulations! You have successfully become an Alterna Staking Delegator. Your staked tokens will now be delegated to the chosen validator(s) for the purpose of securing the network and participating in the consensus process. As a delegator, you may be eligible to earn rewards based on the validator's reward distribution policy.

Please note that the actual steps may vary slightly depending on any updates or changes made to the Alterna Network Staking Delegator website or the MetaMask wallet. Make sure to follow the instructions provided on the respective platforms and exercise caution while performing any transactions.
