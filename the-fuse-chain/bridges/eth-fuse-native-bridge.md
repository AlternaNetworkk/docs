# Alterna: Ethereum â†” Alterna

Alterna native bridge between Ethereum and Alterna is used to relay the Alterna native token from Alterna to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Alterna bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Alterna tokens between the Alterna chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Alterna or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Alterna tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Alterna chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Alterna chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Alterna chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Alterna chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On Alterna you send native Alterna token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Alterna token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Alterna token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Alterna native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
